# G0B3 ONLINE ( AN ELECTRONIC FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM )


## INTRODUCTION

We love cooked beans(Gob3) and with the increasing popularity of food delivery, it was only right we made it more accessible to people. 
This project is aimed at developing a complete online ordering system for use in the food industry. 
It connects food lovers( cooked beans ) to their favorite food joints. 
It does that by making it easy for customers/consumers to LOCATE, ORDER FOOD, PAY and get their favorite dish DELIVERED to them. 



## PROJECT STATEMENT

As the world continues to develop at a fast pace, the manual method of going to local food joints/outlet to purchase food is becoming obsolete and more tasking. 


With this project, food can be ordered through the internet and payment made without going to the restaurant or the food vendor
